# NHL Teams React Project

This project is practice at React/JSX, structure, Git, etc., done in multiple steps.

1. Use NHL API to pull in team information. (https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/teams/)
2. Locally saved team logos for use in project.
3. Alphabetize teams based on location.
4. Set up component to utilize team ID to pull in specific record information (ex: https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/teams/5/stats)
5. Create Loader component. Add to initial team/record load.
_6. Sort feature. This will sort alphabetically, by wins, by losses, and by OT losses. Started, but need to figure out how to sort between 2 parent/child components pulling in from 2 separate API endpoints._
